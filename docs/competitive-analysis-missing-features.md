Stack Sports demonstrates the potential for advanced features like athlete development tools, recruiting platforms, and media integration, but these represent longer-term opportunities rather than immediate competitive necessities.

The recommended phased approach balances feature development with maintaining our core SMS automation strengths while gradually building toward a comprehensive league management platform.
