# Build Fix Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **Twilio Studio Service Errors**: The Twilio Studio API usage had incorrect method chaining that didn't match the SDK types.
2. **MealPlan Management Type Mismatch**: The status field in the MealPlanManagement component was missing the 'discontinued' value that exists in the Firestore schema.
3. **Missing CSS Files**: The layout was trying to import CSS files that didn't exist.
4. **Empty Directories**: Several empty directories in the API routes were causing issues.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Twilio Studio Service Fix
- Updated the API calls in `lib/twilio-studio-service.ts` to use the correct method chaining:
  ```typescript
  // Before
  .flows.executions(executionSid)
  
  // After
  .flows('FW_FLOW_SID').executions(executionSid)
  ```

### 2. MealPlan Management Component Fix
- Added 'discontinued' to the status type definition in `components/MealPlanManagement.tsx`
- Added 'discontinued' option to the status select dropdown

### 3. CSS Files
- Created a minimal `globals.css` file to satisfy the import requirements
- Ensured all required CSS files are either present or properly handled

### 4. Directory Cleanup
- Removed empty directories in the API routes that were causing build issues
