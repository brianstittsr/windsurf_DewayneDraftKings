# Payment Method Improvements: PayPal Replaces CashApp

## Summary of Changes

Replaced CashApp with PayPal for a significantly better user experience.

## Why PayPal is Better Than CashApp

### **CashApp Issues** ❌
1. **Clunky QR Code Flow** - Users must scan QR codes with their phone
2. **Redirect Hell** - Multiple redirects between Stripe → CashApp → Return
3. **Error Prone** - Frequent "payment failed" popups even when redirecting
4. **Confusing UX** - Users don't understand the QR code scanning process
5. **Mobile Only** - Primarily designed for mobile apps, not web checkout
6. **Limited Adoption** - Smaller user base compared to PayPal

### **PayPal Advantages** ✅
1. **Smooth Checkout** - Redirects directly to PayPal hosted page
2. **Higher Trust** - More established brand with better recognition
3. **Wider Adoption** - More users have PayPal accounts than CashApp
4. **Better UX** - Clean redirect → login → pay → return flow
5. **Cross-Platform** - Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile
6. **Professional** - Looks more legitimate for business transactions
