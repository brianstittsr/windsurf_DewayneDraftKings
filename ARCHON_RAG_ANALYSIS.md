5. **Feature Adoption:** % of users using advanced features (queues, etc.)

### RAG Query 6: Dependency Analysis
**Query:** "Analyze task dependencies and identify critical path items that could delay the project"

**Critical Path Analysis:**
```
CRITICAL PATH:
Story 1.1 (Database) â†’ Story 1.2 (APIs) â†’ Story 1.3 (UI) â†’ QA
                    â†’ Story 1.4 (SMS) â†’ Story 1.5 (Communications)
