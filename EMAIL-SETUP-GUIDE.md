## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Authentication failed"
**Solution:** 
- Gmail: Use App Password, not regular password
- SendGrid: Use "apikey" as username, API key as password
- Check for typos in credentials

### Issue: "Connection timeout"
**Solution:**
- Check EMAIL_HOST and EMAIL_PORT are correct
- Verify firewall isn't blocking port 587
- Try port 465 with `secure: true`

### Issue: "Emails not arriving"
**Solution:**
- Check spam/junk folder
- Verify EMAIL_FROM is a valid email
- For Gmail: Verify sender email in Gmail settings
- For SendGrid: Verify sender identity

### Issue: "Environment variables not found"
**Solution:**
- Restart dev server after adding to `.env.local`
- Check `.env.local` is in project root (not in subdirectory)
- Verify `.env.local` is not in `.gitignore` (it should be!)
- For Vercel: Redeploy after adding variables

### Issue: "Module not found: nodemailer"
**Solution:**
```bash
npm install nodemailer
```

## Email Templates

### Current Templates:
1. **Payment Confirmation** - Sent after successful payment
2. **Registration Confirmation** - Sent after registration (can be same as payment)

### Template Location:
- Webhook: `app/api/payments/webhook/route.ts` (lines 107-146)
- Test: `test-registration-email.js`

### Customizing Templates:
Edit the HTML in the webhook file to match your branding.
